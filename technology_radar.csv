Equity Intrinsics (ESP),Hold,Product,FALSE,EII Research proprietary equity income intrinsic value model implemented using SAP's Event Stream Processing software (ESP) and OneTick.
Pre-Trade,Trial,Product,FALSE,Provides pre-trade analytics to clients.  This product was recently released and will need to be continually enhanced based on client feedback.
Product Management,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"We've seen a steep increase in interest in the topic of digital platforms over the past 12 months. Companies looking to roll out new digital solutions quickly and efficiently are building internal platforms, which offer teams self-service access to the business APIs, tools, knowledge and support necessary to build and operate their own solutions. We find that these platforms are most effective when they're given the same respect as an external product offering. Applying product management to internal platforms means establishing empathy with internal consumers (read: developers) and collaborating with them on the design. Platform product managers establish roadmaps and ensure the platform delivers value to the business and enhances the developer experience. Some owners even create a brand identity for the internal platform and use that to market the benefits to their colleagues. Platform product managers look after the quality of the platform, gather usage metrics, and continuously improve it over time. Treating the platform as a product helps to create a thriving ecosystem and avoids the pitfall of building yet another stagnant, underutilized service-oriented architecture."
User Experience,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,Shift focus to user experinece as a first class citizen.
Proper Scrum,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"Scrum is a worthwhile core for the management of software development.  We should fully embrace Scrum, and not just pieces of it, else we are only granting ourselves a vaneer of competence, which is misleading and distorted."
Kubernetes,Adopt,Technology,FALSE,Kuberentes is an opensource project which originated at Google and solves the problem of deploying containers into a cluster of machines.
Microservices,Adopt,Technology,FALSE,Shift from our monolithic application deployment models towards a distributed services architecture
Kafka,Adopt,Technology,FALSE,"Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. Since being created and open sourced by LinkedIn in 2011, Kafka has quickly evolved from messaging queue to a full-fledged streaming platform."
ESP,Hold,Technology,FALSE,"Event Stream Processor by SAP is a streaming ETL tool.  Although very powerful and easy to use, it has low indusrty adoption, and is hard to test."
DataWatch,Hold,Technology,FALSE,"WYSIWIG dashboarding tool similar to Tableau.  It is very pwerful for integrating streaming analytics with historical data, however, it is brittle and buggy."
PERL,Hold,Technology,FALSE,"We have significant footprint in PERL, but, have been steadily using Phython instead."
Redis,Trial,Technology,FALSE,"Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster."
ETF Assset Master,Adopt,Data,TRUE,We have our own view of how the ETF Issuer / Issue Hierarchy shoud be.  WE need to lverage all our vendor data sources and present this model across all our ETF data products.
Morning Start ETF Data,Assess,Data,TRUE,Morningstar is upping their game with ETF holdings and classificaitons.  We should explore the quality of this product vs BBG and Markit.
Bloomberg FIGI,Trial,Data,TRUE,"Bloomberg has opensourced their finaicial identifier models. We have been using their unique time invariant IDs for a few years now, and should more broadly adopt this system."
ETP Product Platform,Adopt,Product,TRUE,A project specifically to re-imagine our core timeseries and reference data around ETFs.
Theme Machine,Trial,Product,TRUE,"Follow the Flow 2.0 via an interactive web interface, plus with unique look-through analytics, like factor flow and esg scoring."
Delta-One,Trial,Product,TRUE,Equity Delta-One product will need to be enhanced to do forward looking holdings analysis as well as bespoke portfolio/ liquidity sleave analysis.
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a techniquefor capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We recommend storing these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself. For most projects, we see no reason why you wouldn't want to use this technique."
Continuous Deployment,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"If you are wondering “What comes after agile?,” you should look towards continuous delivery. While your development processes may be fully optimized, it still might take your organization weeks or months to get a single change into production. Continuous delivery focuses on maximizing automation including infrastructure as code, environment management and deployment automation to ensure your system is always ready for production. It is about tightening your feedback loops and not putting off anything until the end. Continuous delivery is not the same as continuous deployment, which means deploying every change to production. Continuous delivery is not a cowboy show. It puts you in charge of your production environment. The business can pick and choose what and when to deploy. If you think you’ve nailed agile development, but aren’t considering how to achieve continuous delivery, you really haven’t even started."
Graph Search,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,Semantic search
Jupyeter for Automated Testing,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"We're seeing some interesting reports of using Jupyter for automated testing. The ability to mix code, comments and output in the same document reminds us of FIT, FitNesse and Concordion. This flexible approach is particularly useful if your tests are data heavy or rely on some statistical analysis such as performance testing. Python provides all the power you need, but as tests grow in complexity, a way to manage suites of notebooks would be helpful."
OpenFIN,Assess,Technology,TRUE,"OpenFin enables you to build multi-window desktop apps that look and feel just like native installed apps so you can maximize your desktop real estate. Your windows can sit anywhere on the desktop, with or without frames. Apps you don’t actively watch can be minimized and automatically popped up when needed. Legacy and Web apps share the same desktop side-by-side."
Finsemble,Assess,Technology,TRUE,Finsemble is the first application integration platform that allows financial firms to quickly and easily deploy applications to the desktop using powerful APIs for interoperability and workspace management.
Glassbox,Assess,Technology,TRUE,"Imagine if your website or mobile app could see exactly what your customers do in real time, and why they did it? This is Glassbox. The first Enterprise analytics platform that analyses every digital customer interaction. Can your website afford not to ha"
Kotlin,Assess,Technology,TRUE,"Kotlin has experienced an accelerated rate of adoption and rapid growth of tooling support. Some of the reasons behind its popularity are its concise syntax, null safety, ease of transition from Java and interoperability with other JVM-based languages in general, and that it doubles as a great introductory language to functional programming. With JetBrains adding the ability to compile Kotlin to native binaries on multiple platforms, as well as transpile to JavaScript, we believe it has the potential of much wider use by the larger community of mobile and native application developers. Although at the time of writing, some of the tooling such as static and coverage code analysis have yet to mature, given our experience of using Kotlin in many production applications, we believe Kotlin is ready for general adoption."
Cayley,Trial,Technology,TRUE,Opensource graph inspired by the graph database behind Freebase and Google's Knoweldge Graph.
